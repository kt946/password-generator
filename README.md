# Password Generator

For this week's challenge, I built a password generator using my knowledge of JavaScript that consists of variables, functions, if-else loops, for loops, object properties, strings, prompts, and confirm windows. When activated, the generator will display to the user a series of prompts asking for the length of the password and what types of characters should be included. The generator also includes validation checks to handle edge cases in user input.

## The following image depicts a screenshot of the completed password generator:
