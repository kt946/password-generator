# Password Generator

## Description

For this week's challenge, I built a password generator using my knowledge of JavaScript that consists of variables, functions, if-else loops, for loops, object properties, strings, prompts, and confirm windows. When activated, the generator will display to the user a series of prompts asking for the length of the password and what types of characters should be included. The generator also includes validation checks to handle edge cases in user input.

## Usage

To use this application, clone the repository into a directory on your local machine, then navigate to the folder containing the index.html. Open the index.html file and a browser will display the page. Click on the "generate password" button and answer the prompts to create your unique password.
